settei-example
==============

A minimal Flask app which illustrates the use of settei.

* Once cloning the project run :code:`python setup.py install`
* Currently settei is not on pypi, so the best way is to install it by getting the package from github [a link](https://github.com/paylogic/settei)
* Start the app by running python main.py
