settei-example
==============

A minimal Flask app which illustrates the use of [settei](https://github.com/paylogic/settei).

* Once cloning the project run `python setup.py install`
* Currently settei is not on pypi so the best way is to install it by getting the package from github, which can be found [here](https://github.com/paylogic/settei).
* Start the app by running `python main.py`
